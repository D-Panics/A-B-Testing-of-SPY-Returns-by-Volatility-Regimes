# A-B-Testing-of-SPY-Returns-by-Volatility-Regimes
This project implements an A/B style test on SPY daily returns to investigate whether next-day returns differ following high- versus low-volatility days. High- and low-volatility regimes are defined using rolling 20-day and 60-day standard deviations.

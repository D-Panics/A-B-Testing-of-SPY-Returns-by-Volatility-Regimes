# A-B-Testing-of-SPY-Returns-by-Volatility-Regimes
This project implements an A/B style test on SPY daily returns to investigate whether next-day returns differ following high- versus low-volatility days. High- and low-volatility regimes are defined using rolling 20-day and 60-day standard deviations.

## Key Results:

-- No statistically significant difference in mean next-day returns across volatility regimes (p > 0.05).

-- Provides an example of hypothesis formulation, A/B testing, and statistical interpretation in a financial context.
